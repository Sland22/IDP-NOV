For this IDP I looked at a game that i realy enjoy (The Snake Game) and tried to recreate the basic functions of the game. I used a combination of stuff I learn last year such as creating the walls and random location aswell as new stuff I learned from class and youtube an example of this is when I made the snake get bigger after eating the food. After this project I felt more comforatable with momentum and direction of objects.
